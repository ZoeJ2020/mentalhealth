        <h1>Coping Mechanisms</h1>
        <p>Coping mechanisms can help reduce stress and regulate emotions during difficult situations. 
            However, some coping mechanisms such as overeating or losing sleep can be dangerous to your 
            mental wellbeing.
        <br>
        <br>
            Below are some healthy coping mechanisms to keep in mind when feeling overwhelmed.</p>
    </section>

        <div class="coping-list">
            <h2><i class="fas fa-heart"></i> Clean around the house</h2>
            <p>Taking a few minutes out of the day to clean your room or other places in the house can give your brain a moment 
                to slow down. Keeping your house tidy also helps you feel less stressed compared to a constantly messy 
                living space.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="coping-list">
            <h2><i class="fas fa-heart"></i> Keep a well-balanced diet</h2>
            <p>Your body and brain work best when fuelled with the right nutrients. Eating too much junk food that has high 
                levels  of salt and fat can leave you feeling more tired and lethargic than if you had eaten home-cooked nutritious 
                food.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="coping-list">
            <h2><i class="fas fa-heart"></i> Take a walk outside</h2>
            <p>Exercise can serve as a natural and healthy form of stress relief. Running, yoga, swimming, walking, dance, team 
                sports, and many other types of physical activity can help people cope with stress and the aftereffects of 
                traumatic events.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="coping-list">
            <h2><i class="fas fa-heart"></i> Talk about your concerns</h2>
            <p>If difficulties in your life are getting to you, reach out to someone you trust to try and help. This can be a family 
                member, friend, coworker or a teacher. Having someone know what you're going through can bring relief in 
                knowing you're not struggling on your own.
