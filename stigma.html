    <h1 class="title">Stigma vs Truth</h1>

    <div class="stigma-list">
        <button class="collapsible">People with mental health disorders such as 
            schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are 
            dangerous and violent</button>
        <div class="content">Whilst a symptom of these disorders can be unpredictable behaviour, most 
            people with these disorders are not violent - especially those who are going 
            through treatment.</div>

        <button class="collapsible">Mental health disorders are caused by bad 
            parenting</button>
        <div class="content">Disorders have many underlying causes including genetics, drug abuse and
            trauma from past experiences. Making mistakes when raising a child will 
            not directly result in them having a disorder.</div>

        <button class="collapsible">You are unable to help someone with a mental health 
            problem</button>
        <div class="content">However hopeless the situation may seem in the moment, the smallest things 
            can make a big difference to people struggling with their mental health. 
            Talking to them, encouraging healthy coping mechanisms and spending time 
            with the person struggling can help remind them that they are supported 
            when times get tough.</div>

        <button class="collapsible">You can never recover from a mental illness</button>
        <div class="content">Mental illnesses are treatable regardless of age, race, gender or class. 
            When treated, people with mental health problems can live very
            successful and fulfiling lives.</div>

        <button class="collapsible">You can get past your mental health problems if you
            try hard enough</button>
        <div class="content">While it may sound like a positive approach, not all mental health problems 
            can be recovered quicker through effort.<br><br>
            
            All mental health problems are different, and placing strain on yourself to 
            recover risks putting yourself into further mental health problems and stress.<br><br>
            
            If you wish to get treatment for your mental health please seek a professional's 
            advice to reduce the risk of overworking yourself and going down the wrong road 
            to recovery.</div>

                in your current situation, our <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page has a list of services available 
                for you whenever, wherever.</em></p>
